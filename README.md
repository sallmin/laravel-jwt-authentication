# Laravel JWT Authentication
## Installation steps

- Clone the project
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run the migrations
- Run `php artisan db:seed`
- Run command: `php artisan jwt:secret`
- You should be good now :) 

#### JWT package used https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth

##### I am too lazy to create this from scratch for each project.
